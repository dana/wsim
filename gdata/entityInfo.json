Let's go with 2kg per m^2 for stem, half that for root energy. minimum-temp: at -10C or lower this plant starts to die. maximum-temp: at 40C or higher this plant starts to die. That is, this wheatgrass has a very broad temperature range. growth-rate: under ideal conditions, this plants energy is multiplied by 1.002 per hour of sunlight."
